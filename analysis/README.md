# Measurement artefacts

Small, expensive-to-reproduce measurements that decisions in this project rest
on. They live in git because the reasoning in `docs/sweep-findings.md` and
`cluster/README.md` cites them, and because each cost GPU time that a reader
should not have to spend again to check the claim.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `budget-gemma4-e4b.jsonl` | 24 `zero_shot` prompts spanning all six tasks, generated at a 2048 cap with exact `n_new_tokens` per row. The measurement that set `MAX_NEW_TOKENS["zero_shot"]`: at 64 tokens this model scored 3/24, at 2048 it scored 24/24 with no row reaching the cap. |
| `budget-qwen3-8b.jsonl` | the same 24 prompts on Qwen3-8B with `enable_thinking=False` |
| `budget-qwen3-8b-THINKING.jsonl` | three of those rows with thinking **on**, kept as the before-picture: 1179 mean tokens on a `node_count` question the same model answers in 105 without |
| `truncated_keys.json` | historical record of the **271** thinking-arm rows that were hand-labelled non-terminating. No longer consulted: every tracked row now carries `hit_cap`. Kept because it is the provenance of a claim, and because two of its rows turn out to have terminated. |
| `sweep_frame.csv` | one row per scored response over the whole tracked sweep, 15,120 rows. **Stale — do not cite; see below.** |
| `failure_sample.csv` | the stratified manual-inspection sample, 56 rows with full response text. **Stale — do not cite; see below.** |

## The two CSVs, and what is in them now

Both were regenerated on 2026-08-29, after the prompt-rewording re-run and with the
current `scoring._extract_boolean`. They supersede the versions committed at
`3545662`, which were written before both changes and understated parse rates
badly -- `unparsed` alone fell from 342 rows to 70.

`sweep_frame.csv` carries three columns the earlier version did not:

- `wording` -- `revised` / `original` / `unaffected`, marking which text produced the
  row. The obsolete `zero_cot` rows keep the original `filler` and `edge_existence`
  wording, so `condition` alone does not identify the prompt. Group by this before
  comparing anything that touches those cells.
- `non_terminating_source` -- `recorded` where the row carries its own `hit_cap`,
  `ground_truth_file` where `truncated_keys.json` is still the only record.
- `n_new_tokens` -- present only on regenerated rows; empty, not zero, elsewhere.

## The batching baseline

`budget-gemma4-e4b.jsonl` and `budget-qwen3-8b.jsonl` are the reference for
verifying a batched implementation. Decoding is greedy, so a correct batch must
reproduce these responses near-identically. That check matters more than it
sounds: **Qwen3's tokenizer defaults to `padding_side='right'` while Gemma's
defaults to `'left'`**, and for a decoder-only model the wrong padding side
produces fluent, well-formed, entirely wrong text rather than an error.

## Not kept

The prompt subsets used to drive these runs (`diag_prompts`, `think_probe`,
`tail-probe`, `redo-*`) are regenerable from `prompts_zero_shot.jsonl` plus
`truncated_keys.json`, and are not tracked.
